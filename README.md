# PALMS — Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Traffic Signal Control
### Palapye, Botswana · Triple Intersection Network

Three traffic lights. One cooperative policy. Trained with MAPPO to minimise waiting times across a real-world road layout.

---

## What This Is

PALMS trains a multi-agent reinforcement learning system to control the three signalised intersections along the A1 highway corridor through Palapye. Each traffic light is an independent agent that observes its own queue lengths and waiting times, then decides which green phase to hold or switch to. The agents share a single neural network (parameter sharing) and are trained cooperatively — they all benefit when the whole network flows well, not just one junction.

The algorithm is **MAPPO** (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation) with a **Centralised Critic** — during training, the critic sees the full network state (all three intersections at once) to produce better value estimates, but at deployment each agent makes decisions using only its own local sensor data.

**Actor** — 22-dim local observation → 3 action logits (one per green phase)  
**CentralizedCritic** — 66-dim global state (all 3 agents concatenated) → scalar value  
**Parameter sharing** — one Actor network for all three traffic lights (they have the same structure, so the same "rules" apply to each)

## Local Observation (22 numbers per agent)

| Index | Feature | How it's measured |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 0–7 | Queue length per incoming lane | Halting vehicles, log-scaled |
| 8–15 | Waiting time per incoming lane | Cumulative wait, log-scaled |
| 16–19 | Vehicle count on outgoing lanes | Downstream congestion, log-scaled |
| 20 | Current green phase | Normalised 0–1 |
| 21 | Phase state | 0 = green, 1 = yellow |

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, SUMO 1.24+

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv rl_env
rl_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy gymnasium traci streamlit plotly

# Set SUMO_HOME (Windows — adjust path if needed)
$env:SUMO_HOME = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Eclipse\Sumo"
```

---

## Training

```bash
python train_mappo.py
```

- **4 parallel SUMO environments** — diverse experience, faster data collection
- **1.5 million timesteps** — converges in ~3–4 hours on CPU
- **Curriculum learning** — starts on easy scenarios, adds rush hour and holiday as training progresses
- Saves `mappo_models/best_actor.pth` whenever evaluation reward improves
- Logs every update to `mappo_logs/mappo_train.csv` — open in Excel or plot with pandas

### Curriculum Schedule

| Episode count | Scenarios in pool |
|---|---|
| 0 – 29 | `low`, `normal` |
| 30 – 79 | `normal`, `rush_hour_am`, `rush_hour_pm`, `holiday` |
| 80+ | All scenarios (full random) |

## RL Design

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Algorithm** | MAPPO — Multi-Agent PPO with Centralised Critic |
| **Agents** | 3 (one per traffic light), parameter sharing |
| **Observation** | 22-dim local per agent; 66-dim global for critic |
| **Action** | Discrete(3) per agent — select green phase 0, 1, or 2 |
| **Reward** | Shared: `−tanh(avg_wait / 60s) − 0.1 × queue_ratio − collision/teleport penalties` |
| **Episode length** | 500 RL steps × 3 sim-seconds = 25 simulated minutes |
| **Min green hold** | 5 steps (15 sim-seconds) before a phase switch is allowed |
| **Advantage** | GAE (λ=0.95, γ=0.99) |
| **PPO clip** | ε = 0.2 |
| **Parallel envs** | 4 |

## Traffic Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Direction bias |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | Off-peak, sparse traffic | Mixed |
| `normal` | Weekday mixed flow | Mixed |
| `rush_hour_am` | Heavy inbound morning commute | Inbound |
| `rush_hour_pm` | Heavy outbound evening commute | Outbound |
| `holiday` | Transit traffic through town | Transit |
| `incident` | Two entry edges blocked | Mixed |

## Results (single-agent PPO baseline → MAPPO)

The single-agent baseline (v1.0, Stable Baselines3) treated all three traffic lights as one combined action space. MAPPO separates them into cooperating agents with a shared policy and a centralised critic, improving coordination at the cost of a more complex training setup.

Training logs are saved to `mappo_logs/mappo_train.csv`. Plot mean reward over timesteps to track convergence.
